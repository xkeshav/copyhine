My ides to develop this extension was created when I was reading a website www.pratilpi.com which contains very good collection of hindi literature to read free.

but it blocks the right click so I am unable to copy any line to save offline.

Usage
====
 - Click to icon and then right click on icon and click on `inspect popup`  and you can see all content of that page in once


[Example URL](http://www.pratilipi.com/read/story/4879888423059456)

I have also added the number with `console.log` in order to see how it executed one by one

Give me suggestions on <xkeshav@gmail.com >  for the optimum and alternative approach
